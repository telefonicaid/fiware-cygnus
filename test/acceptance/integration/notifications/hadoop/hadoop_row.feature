Feature: Stored in hadoop new notifications per row from context broker
    As a cygnus user
    I want to be able to store in hadoop new notifications per row from context broker
    so that they become more functional and useful

    @happy_path
    Scenario Outline:  store in hadoop new notifications from context broker
       Given cygnus is installed with type "row"
         And "hadoop" is installed correctly
        When store in hadoop with a organization "default", resource "default" and the attribute number "default", the compound number "default", the metadata number "default" and content "<content>"
        Then I receive an "OK" http code
         And Validate that the attribute value and type are stored in hadoop
         And Validate that the attribute metadatas are stored in hadoop
         And delete the file created in hadoop
    Examples:
      |content|
      |json   |
      |xml    |

    @organizations
    Scenario Outline:  store in hadoop new notifications with different organizations behavior
       Given cygnus is installed with type "row"
         And "hadoop" is installed correctly
        When store in hadoop with a organization "<organization>", resource "default" and the attribute number "default", the compound number "default", the metadata number "default" and content "<content>"
        Then I receive an "OK" http code
         And Validate that the attribute value and type are stored in hadoop
         And Validate that the attribute metadatas are stored in hadoop
         And delete the file created in hadoop
    Examples:
      |organization |content|
      |org601       |json|
      |org601       |xml|
      |ORGA601      |json|
      |ORGA601      |xml|
      |Orga_61      |json|
      |Orga_61      |xml|
      #|without organization|json|
      #|without organization|xml|
      |with 32 characters|json|
      |with 32 characters|xml|

      |Room2-|json|
      |Room2-|xml|
       
    @attrNumbers
    Scenario Outline:  store in hadoop new notifications with different quantities of attributes
       Given cygnus is installed with type "row"
