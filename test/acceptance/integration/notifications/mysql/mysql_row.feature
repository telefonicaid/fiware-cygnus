Feature: Store in mysql new notifications per row from context broker
  As a cygnus user
  I want to be able to store in mysql new notifications per row from context broker
  so that they become more functional and useful

  @happy_path
  Scenario Outline: stored new notifications in mysql from context broker with or without metadata
    Given copy properties.json file from "epg_properties.json" to test "mysql-sink" and sudo local "false"
    And configuration of cygnus instances with different ports "true", agents files quantity "1", id "test" and in "row" mode
    And copy flume-env.sh, matching table file from "matching_table.conf", log4j.properties, krb5.conf and restart cygnus service. This execution is only once "true"
    And verify if cygnus is installed correctly
    And "mysql" is installed correctly
    And a tenant "tenant_3", service path "/test", resource "room2_room", with attribute number "4", attribute name "random" and attribute type "celcius"
    When receives a notification with attributes value "random", metadata value "True" and content "<content>"
    Then Validate that the attribute value, metadata "true" and type are stored in mysql
    And Close mysql connection
  Examples:
    | content |
    | json    |
    | xml     |
