Feature: Store in mysql new notifications per row from context broker
    As a cygnus user
    I want to be able to store in mysql new notifications per row from context broker
    so that they become more functional and useful

    @happy_path
    Scenario Outline:  store in mysql new notifications from context broker
       Given "mysql" is installed correctly
         And cygnus is installed with type "row"
        When store in mysql with a organization "default", resource "default" and the attribute number "default", the compound number "default", the metadata number "default" and content "<content>"
        Then Validate that the attribute value and type are stored in mysql
         And Validate that the attribute metadatas are stored in mysql
         And Close mysql connection
    Examples:
      |content|
      |json|
      |xml|

    @organizations
    Scenario Outline:  store in mysql new notifications with different organizations behavior
       Given "mysql" is installed correctly
