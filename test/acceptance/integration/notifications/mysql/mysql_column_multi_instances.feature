Feature: start multi-instances of cygnus using mysql sink and column mode
  As a cygnus user
  I want to be able to start multi-instances of cygnus using mysql sink and column mode
  so that they become more functional and useful

  @happy_path @multi_instances
  Scenario Outline: start multi-instances of cygnus using mysql sink, column mode, ports differents and store multiples notifications one by instance and the port defined incremented
    Given copy properties.json file from "epg_properties.json" to test "mysql-sink" and sudo local "false"
    And configuration of cygnus instances with different ports "true", agents files quantity "<instances_number>", id "test" and in "column" mode
    And copy flume-env.sh, matching table file from "matching_table.conf", log4j.properties, krb5.conf and restart cygnus service. This execution is only once "false"
    And verify if cygnus is installed correctly
    And "mysql" is installed correctly
    And create a new database "<tenant>"
    And create a new table "default" with service path "<service_path>", "<attributes_number>" attributes called "<attribute_name>", attribute type "<attribute_type>", attribute data type "text" and metadata data type "text"
    When receives multiples notifications one by instance and the port defined incremented with attributes value "<attribute_value>", metadata value "<metadata_value>" and content "<content>"
    Then Verify that the attribute value is stored in mysql
    And Verify the metadatas are stored in mysql
    And Close mysql connection
    And delete instances files
  Examples:
    | instances_number | tenant                   | service_path | attributes_number | attribute_name | attribute_type | attribute_value | metadata_value | content |
