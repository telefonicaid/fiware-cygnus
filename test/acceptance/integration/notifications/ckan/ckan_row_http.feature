Feature: Stored in ckan new notifications per row from context broker
  As a cygnus user
  I want to be able to store in ckan new notifications per row from context broker
  so that they become more functional and useful

  @happy_path
  Scenario Outline: stored new notifications in ckan from context broker with or without metadata
    Given copy properties.json file from "epg_properties.json" to test "ckan-sink" and sudo local "false"
    And configuration of cygnus instances with different ports "true", agents files quantity "1", id "test" and in "row" mode
    And copy flume-env.sh, matching table file from "default", log4j.properties, krb5.conf and restart cygnus service. This execution is only once "true"
    And verify if cygnus is installed correctly
    And "ckan" is installed correctly
    And a tenant "tenant_3", service path "/servpath01", resource "room_room2", with attribute number "4", attribute name "random" and attribute type "celcius"
    When receives a notification with attributes value "random", metadata value "True" and content "<content>"
    Then I receive an "OK" http code
    And Validate that the attribute value, metadata "true" and type are stored in ckan
  Examples:
    | content |
    | json    |
    | xml     |
