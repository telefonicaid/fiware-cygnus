Feature: start multi-instances of cygnus using ckan sink and column mode
  As a cygnus user
  I want to be able to start multi-instances of cygnus using ckan sink and column mode
  so that they become more functional and useful

  @happy_path @multi_instances
  Scenario Outline: start multi-instances of cygnus using ckan sink, column mode, ports differents and store multiples notifications one by instance and the port defined incremented
    Given copy properties.json file from "epg_properties.json" to test "ckan-sink" and sudo local "false"
    And configuration of cygnus instances with different ports "true", agents files quantity "<instances_number>", id "test" and in "column" mode
    And copy flume-env.sh, matching table file from "default", log4j.properties, krb5.conf and restart cygnus service. This execution is only once "false"
    And verify if cygnus is installed correctly
    And "ckan" is installed correctly
    And create a new organization "<organization>" with a dataset "<service_path>"
    And create a new resource "default" with "1" attributes called "<attribute_name>", attribute type "<attribute_type>", attribute data type "json" and metadata data type "json"
    When receives multiples notifications one by instance and the port defined incremented with attributes value "<attribute_value>", metadata value "<metadata_value>" and content "<content>"
    Then Verify that the attribute value is stored in ckan
    And delete instances files 
  Examples:
    | instances_number | organization                | service_path | attribute_name | attribute_type | attribute_value | metadata_value | content |
