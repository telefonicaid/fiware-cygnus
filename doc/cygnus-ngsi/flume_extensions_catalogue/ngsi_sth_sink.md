## <a name="section1"></a>Functionality
`com.iot.telefonica.cygnus.sinks.NGSISTHSink`, or simply `NGSISTHSink` is a sink designed to persist NGSI-like context data events within a MongoDB server in an aggregated way, specifically these measures are computed:

* For numeric attribute values:
    * Sum of all the samples.
    * Sum of the square value of all the samples.
    * Maximum value among all the samples.
    * Minimum value among all the samples.
* Number of occurrences for string attribute values.

You can get further details on STH Comet and the supported aggregations at [STH Comet Github](https://github.com/telefonicaid/fiware-sth-comet).

Usually, such a context data is notified by a [Orion Context Broker](https://github.com/telefonicaid/fiware-orion) instance, but could be any other system speaking the <i>NGSI language</i>.

Independently of the data generator, NGSI context data is always transformed into internal `NGSIEvent` objects at Cygnus sources. In the end, the information within these events must be mapped into specific HDFS data structures at the Cygnus sinks.

Next sections will explain this in detail.

[Top](#top)

### <a name="section1.1"></a>Mapping NGSI events to `NGSIEvent` objects
Notified NGSI events (containing context data) are transformed into `NGSIEvent` objects (for each context element a `NGSIEvent` is created; such an event is a mix of certain headers and a `ContextElement` object), independently of the NGSI data generator or the final backend where it is persisted.

This is done at the cygnus-ngsi Http listeners (in Flume jergon, sources) thanks to [`NGSIRestHandler`](/ngsi_rest_handler.md). Once translated, the data (now, as `NGSIEvent` objects) is put into the internal channels for future consumption (see next section).

[Top](#top)

### <a name="section1.2"></a>Mapping `NGSIEvent`s to MongoDB data structures
MongoDB organizes the data in databases that contain collections of Json documents. Such organization is exploited by `NGSISTHSink` each time a `NGSIEvent` is going to be persisted.

[Top](#top)

#### <a name="section1.2.1"></a>MongoDB databases and collections naming conventions
A database called as the `fiware-service` header value within the event is created (if not existing yet). A configured prefix is added (by default, `sth_`).

It must be said [MongoDB does not accept](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/limits/#naming-restrictions) `/`, `\`, `.`, `"` and `$` in the database names. This leads to certain [encoding](#section2.3.4) is applied depending on the `enable_encoding` configuration parameter.

MongoDB [namespaces (database + collection) name length](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/limits/#naming-restrictions) is limited to 113 bytes.

[Top](#top)

#### <a name="section1.2.2"></a>MongoDB collections naming conventions
The name of these collections depends on the configured data model and analysis mode (see the [Configuration](#section2.1) section for more details):

* Data model by service path (`data_model=dm-by-service-path`). As the data model name denotes, the notified FIWARE service path (or the configured one as default in [`NGSIRestHandler`](./ngsi_rest_handler.md)) is used as the name of the collection. This allows the data about all the NGSI entities belonging to the same service path is stored in this unique table. The configured prefix is prepended to the collection name, while `.aggr` sufix is appended to it.
* Data model by entity (`data_model=dm-by-entity`). For each entity, the notified/default FIWARE service path is concatenated to the notified entity ID and type in order to compose the collections name. If the FIWARE service path is the root one (`/`) then only the entity ID and type are concatenated. The configured prefix is prepended to the collection name, while `.aggr` sufix is appended to it.
* Data model by attribute (`data_model=dm-by-attribute`). For each entity's attribute, the notified/default FIWARE service path is concatenated to the notified entity ID and type and to the notified attribute name in order to compose the collection name. If the FIWARE service path is the root one (`/`) then only the entity ID and type and the attribute name and type are concatenated.  The configured prefix is prepended to the collection name, while `.aggr` sufix is appended to it.

It must be said [MongoDB does not accept](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/limits/#naming-restrictions) `$` in the collection names. This leads to certain [encoding](#section2.3.4) is applied depending on the `enable_encoding` configuration parameter.

MongoDB [namespaces (database + collection) name length](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/limits/#naming-restrictions) is limited to 113 bytes.

The following table summarizes the table name composition (assuming default `sth_` prefix, old encoding):

| FIWARE service path | `dm-by-service-path` | `dm-by-entity` | `dm-by-attribute` |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/` | `sth_/.aggr` | `sth_/<entityId>_<entityType>.aggr` | `sth_/<entityId>_<entityType>_<attrName>.aggr` |
| `/<svcPath>` | `sth_/<svcPath>.aggr` | `sth_/<svcPath>_<entityId>_<entityType>.aggr` | `sth_/<svcPath>_<entityId>_<entityType>_<attrName>.aggr` |

Using the new encoding:

| FIWARE service path | `dm-by-service-path` | `dm-by-entity` | `dm-by-attribute` |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/` | `sth_x002f.aggr` | `sth_x002fxffff<entityId>xffff<entityType>.aggr` | `sth_x002fxffff<entityId>xffff<entityType>xffff<attrName>.aggr` |
| `/<svcPath>` | `sth_x002fxffff<svcPath>.aggr` | `sth_x002fxffff<svcPath>xffff<entityId>xffff<entityType>.aggr` | `sth_x002fxffff<svcPath>xffff<entityId>xffff<entityType>xffff<attrName>.aggr` |

Please observe the concatenation of entity ID and type is already given in the `notified_entities`/`grouped_entities` header values (depending on using or not the grouping rules, see the [Configuration](#section2.1) section for more details) within the `NGSIEvent`.

[Top](#top)

#### <a name="section1.2.3"></a>Storing
As said, `NGSISTHSink` has been designed for pre-aggregating certain statistics about entities and their attributes:

* For numeric attribute values:
    * Sum of all the samples.
    * Sum of the square value of all the samples.
    * Maximum value among all the samples.
    * Minimum value among all the samples.
* Number of occurrences for string attribute values.

This is done by changing the <i>usual</i> behaviour of a NGSI-like sink: instead of appending more and more information elements, a set of information elements (in this case, Json documents within the collections) are created once, and updated many.

There will be at least (see below about the <i>origin</i>) a Json document for each <i>resolution</i> handled by `NGSISTHSink`: month, day, hour, minute and second. For each one of these documents, there will be as many <i>offset</i> fields as the resolution denotes, e.g. for a resolution of "day" ther will be 24 offsets, for a resolution of "second" there will be 60 offsets. Initially, these offsets will be setup to 0 (for numeric aggregations), or `{}` for string aggregations, and as long notifications arrive, these values will be updated depending on the resolution and the offset within that resolution the notification was received.

Each one of the Json documents (each one for each resolution) will also have an <i>origin</i>, the time for which the aggregated information applies. For instance, for a resolution of "minute" a valid origin could be `2015-03-01T13:00:00.000Z`, meaning the 13th hour of March, the 3rd, 2015. There may be another Json document having a different origin for the same resolution, e.g. `2015-03-01T14:00:00.000Z`, meaning the 14th hour of March, the 3rd, 2015. The origin is stored using UTC time to avoid locale issues.

Finally, each document will save the number of <i>samples</i> that were used for updating it. This is useful when getting values such as the average, which is the <i>sum</i> divided by the number of samples.

### <a name="section1.3"></a>Example
#### <a name="section1.3.1"></a>`NGSIEvent`
Assuming the following `NGSIEvent` is created from a notified NGSI context data (the code below is an <i>object representation</i>, not any real data format):

    ngsi-event={
        headers={
	         content-type=application/json,
	         timestamp=1429535775,
	         transactionId=1429535775-308-0000000000,
	         correlationId=1429535775-308-0000000000,
	         fiware-service=vehicles,
	         fiware-servicepath=/4wheels,
	         <grouping_rules_interceptor_headers>,
	         <name_mappings_interceptor_headers>
        },
        body={
	        entityId=car1,
	        entityType=car,
	        attributes=[
	            {
	                attrName=speed,
	                attrType=float,
	                attrValue=112.9
	            },
	            {
	                attrName=oil_level,
	                attrType=float,
	                attrValue=74.6
	            }
	        ]
	    }
    }

#### <a name="section1.3.2"></a>Database and collection names
A MongoDB database named as the concatenation of the prefix and the notified FIWARE service path, i.e. `sth_vehicles`, will be created.

Regarding the collection names, the MongoDB collection names will be, depending on the configured data model, the following ones (old encoding):

| FIWARE service path | `dm-by-service-path` | `dm-by-entity` | `dm-by-attribute` |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/` | `sth_/.aggr` | `sth_/car1_car.aggr` | `sth_/car1_car_speed.aggr`<br>`sth_/car1_car_oil_level.aggr` |
| `/4wheels` | `sth_/4wheels.aggr` | `sth_/4wheels_car1_car.aggr` | `sth_/4wheels_car1_car_speed.aggr`<br>`sth_/4wheels_car1_car_oil_level.aggr` |

Using the new encoding:

| FIWARE service path | `dm-by-service-path` | `dm-by-entity` | `dm-by-attribute` |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/` | `sth_x002f.aggr` | `sth_x002fxffffcar1xffffcar.aggr` | `sth_x002fxffffcar1xffffcarxffffspeed.aggr`<br>`sth_x002fxffffcar1xffffcarxffffoil_level.aggr` |
| `/4wheels` | `sth_x002f4wheels.aggr` | `sth_x002f4wheelsxffffcar1xffffcar.aggr` | `sth_x002f4wheelsxffffcar1xffffcarxffffspeed.aggr`<br>`sth_x002f4wheelsxffffcar1xffffcarxffffoil_level.aggr` |

#### <a name="section1.3.3"></a>Storing
Assuming `data_model=dm-by-entity` and all the possible resolutions as configuration parameters (see section [Configuration](#section2.1) for more details), then `NGSISTHSink` will persist the data within the body as:

### <a name="section2.2"></a>Use cases
Use `NGSISTHSink` if you are looking for a Json-based document storage about aggregated data not growing so much in the mid-long term.

### <a name="section2.3"></a>Important notes
#### <a name="section2.3.1"></a>About batching
As explained in the [programmers guide](#section3), `NGSISTHSink` extends `NGSISink`, which provides a built-in mechanism for collecting events from the internal Flume channel. This mechanism allows extending classes have only to deal with the persistence details of such a batch of events in the final backend.

What is important regarding the batch mechanism is it largely increases the performance of the sink, because the number of writes is dramatically reduced. Let's see an example, let's assume a batch of 100 `NGSIEvent`s. In the best case, all these events regard to the same entity, which means all the data within them will be persisted in the same MongoDB collection. If processing the events one by one, we would need 100 inserts into MongoDB; nevertheless, in this example only one insert is required. Obviously, not all the events will always regard to the same unique entity, and many entities may be involved within a batch. But that's not a problem, since several sub-batches of events are created within a batch, one sub-batch per final destination MongoDB collection. In the worst case, the whole 100 entities will be about 100 different entities (100 different MongoDB collections), but that will not be the usual scenario. Thus, assuming a realistic number of 10-15 sub-batches per batch, we are replacing the 100 inserts of the event by event approach with only 10-15 inserts.

The batch mechanism adds an accumulation timeout to prevent the sink stays in an eternal state of batch building when no new data arrives. If such a timeout is reached, then the batch is persisted as it is.

Regarding the retries of not persisted batches, a couple of parameters is used. On the one hand, a Time-To-Live (TTL) is used, specifying the number of retries Cygnus will do before definitely dropping the event. On the other hand, a list of retry intervals can be configured. Such a list defines the first retry interval, then se second retry interval, and so on; if the TTL is greater than the length of the list, then the last retry interval is repeated as many times as necessary.

By default, `NGSISTHSink` has a configured batch size and batch accumulation timeout of 1 and 30 seconds, respectively. Nevertheless, as explained above, it is highly recommended to increase at least the batch size for performance purposes. Which are the optimal values? The size of the batch it is closely related to the transaction size of the channel the events are got from (it has no sense the first one is greater then the second one), and it depends on the number of estimated sub-batches as well. The accumulation timeout will depend on how often you want to see new data in the final storage. A deeper discussion on the batches of events and their appropriate sizing may be found in the [performance document](https://github.com/telefonicaid/fiware-cygnus/blob/master/doc/cygnus-ngsi/installation_and_administration_guide/performance_tips.md).

#### <a name="section2.3.2"></a>About `recvTime` and `TimeInstant` metadata
By default, `NGSISTHSink` stores the notification reception timestamp. Nevertheless, if a metadata named `TimeInstant` is notified, then such metadata value is used instead of the reception timestamp. This is useful when wanting to persist a measure generation time (which is thus notified as a `TimeInstant` metadata) instead of the reception time.

#### <a name="section2.3.3"></a>About the encoding
`NGSIMongoSink` follows the [MongoDB naming restrictions](https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/limits/#naming-restrictions). In a nutshell:

Until version 1.2.0 (included), Cygnus applied a very simple encoding:

* Database names will have the characters `\`, `/`, `.`, `$`, `"` and ` ` encoded as `_`.
* Collections names will have the characters `$` encoded as `_`.

From version 1.3.0 (included), Cygnus applies this specific encoding tailored to MongoDB data structures:

* Equals character, `=`, is encoded as `xffff`.
* All the forbidden characters are encoded as a `x` character followed by the [Unicode](http://unicode-table.com) of the character.
* User defined strings composed of a `x` character and a Unicode are encoded as `xx` followed by the Unicode.
* `xffff` is used as concatenator character.

Despite the old encoding will be deprecated in the future, it is possible to switch the encoding type through the `enable_encoding` parameter as explained in the [configuration](#section2.1) section.

#### <a name="section2.3.4"></a>About supported versions of MongoDB
This sink has been tested with the following versions of Mongo:

* 3.2.6
* 3.4

## <a name="section3"></a>Programmers guide
### <a name="section3.1"></a>`NGSISTHSink` class
`NGSISTHSink` extends `NGSIMongoBaseSink`, which as any other NGSI-like sink, extends the base `NGSISink`. The methods that are extended are:

    void persistBatch(Batch batch) throws Exception;

A `Batch` contains a set of `NGSIEvent` objects, which are the result of parsing the notified context data events. Data within the batch is classified by destination, and in the end, a destination specifies the MongoDB collection where the data is going to be persisted. Thus, each destination is iterated in order to compose a per-destination data string to be persisted thanks to any `MongoBackend` implementation.

    public void start();

An implementation of `MongoBackend` is created. This must be done at the `start()` method and not in the constructor since the invoking sequence is `NGSISTHSink()` (contructor), `configure()` and `start()`.

    public void configure(Context);

A complete configuration as the described above is read from the given `Context` instance.

[Top](#top)

### <a name="section3.2"></a>`MongoBackend` class
This is a convenience backend class for MongoDB that provides methods to persist the context data both in raw of aggregated format. Relevant methods regarding raw format are:

    public void createDatabase(String dbName) throws Exception;

Creates a database, given its name, if not exists.

    public void createCollection(String dbName, String collectionName) throws Exception;

Creates a collection, given its name, if not exists in the given database.

    public void insertContextDataRaw(String dbName, String collectionName, long recvTimeTs, String recvTime, String entityId, String entityType, String attrName, String attrType, String attrValue, String attrMd) throws Exception;

Updates or inserts (depending if the document already exists or not) a set of documents in the given collection within the given database. Such a set of documents contains all the information regarding current and past notifications (historic) for a single attribute. a set of documents is managed since historical data is stored using several resolutions and range combinations (second-minute, minute-hour, hour-day, day-month and month-year). See STH Comet at [Github](https://github.com/telefonicaid/fiware-sth-comet/blob/master/README.md) for more details.

Nothing special is done with regards to the encoding. Since Cygnus generally works with UTF-8 character set, this is how the data is written into the collections. It will responsability of the MongoDB client to convert the bytes read into UTF-8.

### <a name="section3.3"></a>Authentication and authorization
Current implementation of `NGSIMongoSink` relies on the username and password credentials created at the MongoDB endpoint.
