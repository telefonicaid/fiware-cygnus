##<a name="section1"></a>Functionality
`com.iot.telefonica.cygnus.sinks.NGSIKafkaSink`, or simply `NGSIKafkaSink` is a sink designed to persist NGSI-like context data events within a [Apache Kafka](http://kafka.apache.org/) deployment. Usually, such a context data is notified by a [Orion Context Broker](https://github.com/telefonicaid/fiware-orion) instance, but could be any other system speaking the <i>NGSI language</i>.

Independently of the data generator, NGSI context data is always transformed into internal Flume events at Cygnus sources. In the end, the information within these Flume events must be mapped into specific Kafka data structures at the Cygnus sinks.

Next sections will explain this in detail.

###<a name="section1.1"></a>Mapping NGSI events to flume events
Notified NGSI events (containing context data) are transformed into Flume events (such an event is a mix of certain headers and a byte-based body), independently of the NGSI data generator or the final backend where it is persisted.

This is done at the Cygnus Http listeners (in Flume jergon, sources) thanks to [`NGSIRestHandler`](./orion_rest_handler.md). Once translated, the data (now, as a Flume event) is put into the internal channels for future consumption (see next section).

###<a name="section1.2"></a>Mapping Flume events to Kafka data structures
[Apache Kafka organizes](http://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#introduction) the data in topics (a category or feed name to which messages are published). Such organization is exploited by `NGSIKafkaSink` each time a Flume event is going to be persisted.

A Kafka topic is created (number of partitions 1) if not yet existing depending on the configured data model:

* `dm-by-attribute`. A topic named `<fiware-service>_<fiware_servicePath_without_slash>_<entityId>_<entityType>_<attributeName>` is created for each notified attribute.
* `dm-by-entity`. A topic named `<fiware-service>_<fiware_servicePath_without_slash>_<entityId>_<entityType>` is created, where values are got from the event headers.
* `dm-by-service-path`. A topic named `<fiware-service>_<fiware_servicePath_without_slash>` is created, where `<fiware-servicePath>` value is got from the event headers.
* `dm-by-service`. A topic named `<fiware-service>` is created, where `<fiware-service>` value is got from the event headers.

The context responses/entities within the container are iterated, and they are serialized in the Kafka topic as JSON documents.

###<a name="section1.3"></a>Example
Assuming the following Flume event is created from a notified NGSI context data (the code below is an <i>object representation</i>, not any real data format):

    flume-event={
        headers={
	         content-type=application/json,
	         timestamp=1429535775,
	         transactionId=1429535775-308-0000000000,
	         ttl=10,
	         fiware-service=vehicles,
	         fiware-servicepath=/4wheels,
	         notified-entities=car1_car
	         notified-servicepaths=/4wheels
	         grouped-entities=car1_car
	         grouped-servicepath=/4wheels
        },
        body={
	        entityId=car1,
	        entityType=car,
	        attributes=[
	            {
	                attrName=speed,
	                attrType=float,
	                attrValue=112.9
	            },
	            {
	                attrName=oil_level,
	                attrType=float,
	                attrValue=74.6
	            }
	        ]
	    }
    }

Assuming `data_model=dm-by-attribute` as configuration parameter, then `NGSIKafkaSink` will persist the data as:

    $ bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --zookeeper localhost:2181 --topic vehicles_4wheels_car1_car_speed --from-beginning
    {"headers":[{"fiware-service":"vehicles"},{"fiware-servicePath":"/4wheels"},{"timestamp":1429535775}],"body":{"contextElement":{"attributes":[{"name":"speed","type":"float","value":"112.9"}],"type":"car","isPattern":"false","id":"car1"},"statusCode":{"code":"200","reasonPhrase":"OK"}}}
    $ bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --zookeeper localhost:2181 --topic vehicles_4wheels_car1_car_oil_level --from-beginning
    {"headers":[{"fiware-service":"vehicles"},{"fiware-servicePath":"4wheels"},{"timestamp":1429535775}],"body":{"contextElement":{"attributes":[{"name":"oil_level","type":"float","value":"74.6"}],"type":"car","isPattern":"false","id":"car1"},"statusCode":{"code":"200","reasonPhrase":"OK"}}}

If `data_model=dm-by-entity` then `NGSIKafkaSink` will persist the data as:

    $ bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --zookeeper localhost:2181 --topic vehicles_4wheels_car1_car --from-beginning
    {"headers":[{"fiware-service":"vehicles"},{"fiware-servicePath":"/4wheels"},{"timestamp":1429535775}],"body":{"contextElement":{"attributes":[{"name":"speed","type":"float","value":"112.9"},{"name":"oil_level","type":"float","value":"74.6"}],"type":"car","isPattern":"false","id":"car1"},"statusCode":{"code":"200","reasonPhrase":"OK"}}}

If `data_model=dm-by-service-path` then `NGSIKafkaSink` will persist the data as:

    $ bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --zookeeper localhost:2181 --topic vehicles_4wheels --from-beginning
    {"headers":[{"fiware-service":"vehicles"},{"fiware-servicePath":"/4wheels"},{"timestamp":1429535775}],"body":{"contextElement":{"attributes":[{"name":"speed","type":"float","value":"112.9"},{"name":"oil_level","type":"float","value":"74.6"}],"type":"car","isPattern":"false","id":"car1"},"statusCode":{"code":"200","reasonPhrase":"OK"}}}

If `data_model=dm-by-service` then `NGSIKafkaSink` will persist the data as:

    $ bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --zookeeper localhost:2181 --topic vehicles --from-beginning
    {"headers":[{"fiware-service":"vehicles"},{"fiware-servicePath":"/4wheels"},{"timestamp":1429535775}],"body":{"contextElement":{"attributes":[{"name":"speed","type":"float","value":"112.9"},{"name":"oil_level","type":"float","value":"74.6"}],"type":"car","isPattern":"false","id":"car1"},"statusCode":{"code":"200","reasonPhrase":"OK"}}}

NOTE: `bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh` is a script distributed with Kafka that runs a Kafka consumer.

###<a name="section2.3"></a>Important notes
####<a name="section2.3.1"></a>About batching
As explained in the [programmers guide](#section3), `NGSIKafkaSink` extends `NGSISink`, which provides a built-in mechanism for collecting events from the internal Flume channel. This mechanism allows exteding classes have only to deal with the persistence details of such a batch of events in the final backend.

What is important regarding the batch mechanism is it largely increases the performance of the sink, because the number of writes is dramatically reduced. Let's see an example, let's assume a batch of 100 Flume events. In the best case, all these events regard to the same entity, which means all the data within them will be persisted in the same Kafka topic. If processing the events one by one, we would need 100 writes to Kafka; nevertheless, in this example only one write is required. Obviously, not all the events will always regard to the same unique entity, and many entities may be involved within a batch. But that's not a problem, since several sub-batches of events are created within a batch, one sub-batch per final destination Kafka topic. In the worst case, the whole 100 entities will be about 100 different entities (100 different Kafka topics), but that will not be the usual scenario. Thus, assuming a realistic number of 10-15 sub-batches per batch, we are replacing the 100 writes of the event by event approach with only 10-15 writes.

The batch mechanism adds an accumulation timeout to prevent the sink stays in an eternal state of batch building when no new data arrives. If such a timeout is reached, then the batch is persisted as it is.

By default, `NGSIKafkaSink` has a configured batch size and batch accumulation timeout of 1 and 30 seconds, respectively. Nevertheless, as explained above, it is highly recommended to increase at least the batch size for performance purposes. Which are the optimal values? The size of the batch it is closely related to the transaction size of the channel the events are got from (it has no sense the first one is greater then the second one), and it depends on the number of estimated sub-batches as well. The accumulation timeout will depend on how often you want to see new data in the final storage. A deeper discussion on the batches of events and their appropriate sizing may be found in the [performance document](../operation/performance_tuning_tips.md).

##<a name="section3"></a>Programmers guide
###<a name="section3.1"></a>`NGSIKafkaSink` class
As any other NGSI-like sink, `NGSIKafkaSink` extends the base `NGSISink`. The methods that are extended are:

    void persistBatch(Batch batch) throws Exception;

A `Batch` contanins a set of `CygnusEvent` objects, which are the result of parsing the notified context data events. Data within the batch is classified by destination, and in the end, a destination specifies the Kafka topic where the data is going to be persisted. Thus, each destination is iterated in order to compose a per-destination data string to be persisted thanks to the `KafkaProducer`.

    public void start();

`KafkaProducer` is created. This must be done at the `start()` method and not in the constructor since the invoking sequence is `NGSIKafkaSink()` (contructor), `configure()` and `start()`.

    public void configure(Context);

A complete configuration as the one described above is read from the given `Context` instance.

###<a name="section3.2"></a>`KafkaProducer` class (backend)
The implementation of a class dealing with the details of the backend is given by Kafka itself through the [`KafkaProducer`](http://kafka.apache.org/082/javadoc/org/apache/kafka/clients/producer/KafkaProducer.html) class. Thus, the sink has been developed by invoking the methods within that class, specially:

    public send(ProducerRecord<K,V>);

Which sends a [`ProducerRecord`](http://kafka.apache.org/082/javadoc/org/apache/kafka/clients/producer/ProducerRecord.html) object to the configured topic.
