# Reporting issues and contact information
There are several channels suited for reporting issues and asking for doubts in general. Each one depends on the nature of the question:

* Use [stackoverflow.com](http://stackoverflow.com) for specific questions about this software. Typically, these will be related to installation problems, errors and bugs. Development questions when forking the code are welcome as well. Use the `fiware-cygnus` tag.
* Use [ask.fiware.org](https://ask.fiware.org/questions/) for general questions about FIWARE, e.g. how many cities are using FIWARE, how can I join the accelarator program, etc. Even for general questions about this software, for instance, use cases or architectures you want to discuss.
