##<a name="prerequisites"></a>Prerequisites
Maven (and thus Java SDK, since Maven is a Java tool) is needed in order to install Cygnus.

In order to install Java SDK (not JRE), just type (CentOS machines):

    $ yum install java-1.6.0-openjdk-devel

Remember to export the JAVA_HOME environment variable. In the case of using `yum install` as shown above, it would be:

    $ export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.6.0-openjdk.x86_64

In order to do it permanently, edit `/root/.bash_profile` (`root` user) or `/etc/profile` (other users).

Maven is installed by downloading it from [maven.apache.org](http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi). Install it in a folder of your choice (represented by `APACHE_MAVEN_HOME`):

    $ wget http://www.eu.apache.org/dist/maven/maven-3/3.2.5/binaries/apache-maven-3.2.5-bin.tar.gz
    $ tar xzvf apache-maven-3.2.5-bin.tar.gz
    $ mv apache-maven-3.2.5 APACHE_MAVEN_HOME

##<a name="usercreation"></a>Cygnus user creation
It is highly recommended to create a `cygnus` Unix user, under which Cygnus will be installed and run. By the way, this is how the [RPM](./src_rpm.md) proceeds.

Creating such a user is quite simple. As a sudoer user (root or any other allowed), type the following:

    $ (sudo) useradd cygnus
    
You may add a password or not to the `cygnus` user:

    $ (sudo) passwd cygnus
    
Once created, change to this new fresh user in order to proceed with the rest of the installation:

    $ su - cygnus

##<a name="installflume"></a>Installing Apache Flume
Apache Flume can be easily installed by downloading its latests version from [flume.apache.org](http://flume.apache.org/download.html). Move the untared directory to a folder of your choice (represented by `APACHE_FLUME_HOME`):

    $ wget http://www.eu.apache.org/dist/flume/1.4.0/apache-flume-1.4.0-bin.tar.gz
    $ tar xvzf apache-flume-1.4.0-bin.tar.gz
    $ mv apache-flume-1.4.0-bin APACHE_FLUME_HOME
    $ mkdir -p APACHE_FLUME_HOME/plugins.d/cygnus/
    $ mkdir APACHE_FLUME_HOME/plugins.d/cygnus/lib
    $ mkdir APACHE_FLUME_HOME/plugins.d/cygnus/libext

The creation of the `plugins.d` directory is related to the installation of third-party software, like Cygnus.

##<a name="installcygnus"></a>Installing Cygnus
Then, the developed classes must be packaged in a Java jar file; this can be done by including the dependencies in the package (**recommended**):

    $ git clone https://github.com/telefonicaid/fiware-cygnus.git
    $ git checkout <branch>
    $ cd fiware-cygnus
    $ APACHE_MAVEN_HOME/bin/mvn clean compile exec:exec assembly:single
    $ cp target/cygnus-<x.y.z>-jar-with-dependencies.jar APACHE_FLUME_HOME/plugins.d/cygnus/lib
    $ cp target/classes/cygnus-flume-ng APACHE_FLUME_HOME/bin

or not:

    $ git clone https://github.com/telefonicaid/fiware-cygnus.git
    $ git checkout <branch>
    $ cd fiware-cygnus
    $ APACHE_MAVEN_HOME/bin/mvn exec:exec package
    $ cp target/cygnus-<x.y.z>.jar APACHE_FLUME_HOME/plugins.d/cygnus/lib
    $ cp target/classes/cygnus-flume-ng APACHE_FLUME_HOME/bin

where `<branch>` is `develop` if you are trying to install the latest features or `release/<x.y.z>` if you are trying to install a stable release. `<x.y.z>` stands for a specific version number (e.g. `0.3`, `0.5.1`...).

If the dependencies are included in the built Cygnus package, then nothing has to be done. If not, and depending on the Cygnus components you are going to use, you may need to install additional .jar files under `APACHE_FLUME_HOME/plugins.d/cygnus/libext/`. Typically, you can get the .jar file from your Maven repository (under `.m2` in your user home directory) and use the `cp` command.

In addition:

* Observe the version of `httpcomponents-core` and `httpcomponents-client` in the `pom.xml` are matching the version of such packages within the Flume bundle (`httpclient-4.2.1.jar and httpcore-4.2.1.jar`). These are not the newest versions of such packages, but trying to build Cygnus with such newest libraries has shown incompatibilities with Flume's ones.
* libthrift-0.9.1.jar must overwrite `APACHE_FLUME_HOME/lib/libthrift-0.7.0.jar` (it can be got from the [this](http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/apache/thrift/libthrift/0.9.1/libthrift-0.9.1.jar) URL).

###<a name="ckandeps"></a>OrionCKANSink dependencies
These are the packages you will need to install under `APACHE_FLUME_HOME/plugins.d/cygnus/libext/` **if you did not included them in the Cygnus package**:

* json-simple-1.1.jar

[Top](#top)

###<a name="hdfsdeps"></a>OrionHDFSSink dependencies
These are the packages you will need to install under `APACHE_FLUME_HOME/plugins.d/cygnus/libext/` **if you did not included them in the Cygnus package**:

* hadoop-core-0.20.0.jar (or higher)
* hive-exec-0.12.0.jar
* hive-jdbc-0.12.0.jar
* hive-metastore-0.12.0.jar
* hive-service-0.12.0.jar
* hive-common-0.12.0.jar
* hive-shims-0.12.0.jar

These packages are not necessary to be installed since they are already included in the Flume bundle (they have been listed just for informative purposes):

* httpclient-4.2.1.jar
* httpcore-4.2.2.jar

In addition, as already said, remember to overwrite the `APACHE_FLUME_HOME/lib/libthrift-0.7.0.jar` package with this one:

* libthrift-0.9.1.jar

###<a name="mysqldeps"></a>OrionMysQLSink dependencies
These are the packages you will need to install under `APACHE_FLUME_HOME/plugins.d/cygnus/libext/` **if you did not included them in the Cygnus package**:

* mysql-connector-java-5.1.31-bin.jar

##<a name="contact"></a>Reporting issues and contact information
There are several channels suited for reporting issues and asking for doubts in general. Each one depends on the nature of the question:

* Use [stackoverflow.com](http://stackoverflow.com) for specific questions about this software. Typically, these will be related to installation problems, errors and bugs. Development questions when forking the code are welcome as well. Use the `fiware-cygnus` tag.
* Use [ask.fiware.org](https://ask.fiware.org/questions/) for general questions about FIWARE, e.g. how many cities are using FIWARE, how can I join the accelarator program, etc. Even for general questions about this software, for instance, use cases or architectures you want to discuss.
* Personal email:
    * [francisco.romerobueno@telefonica.com](mailto:francisco.romerobueno@telefonica.com) **[Main contributor]**
    * [fermin.galanmarquez@telefonica.com](mailto:fermin.galanmarquez@telefonica.com) **[Contributor]**
    * [german.torodelvalle@telefonica.com](german.torodelvalle@telefonica.com) **[Contributor]**
    * [ivan.ariasleon@telefonica.com](mailto:ivan.ariasleon@telefonica.com) **[Quality Assurance]**

**NOTE**: Please try to avoid personaly emailing the contributors unless they ask for it. In fact, if you send a private email you will probably receive an automatic response enforcing you to use [stackoverflow.com](stackoverflow.com) or [ask.fiware.org](https://ask.fiware.org/questions/). This is because using the mentioned methods will create a public database of knowledge that can be useful for future users; private email is just private and cannot be shared.
