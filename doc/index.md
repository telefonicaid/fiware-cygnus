#Welcome to Cygnus

Cygnus is a connector in charge of persisting [Orion](https://github.com/telefonicaid/fiware-orion) context data in certain configured third-party storages, creating a historical view of such data

Github's [README.md](https://github.com/telefonicaid/fiware-cygnus/blob/master/README.md) provides a good documentation summary. The [Installation and Administration Guide](./installation_and_administration_guide/introduction.md) and the [User and Programmer Guide](./user_and_programmer_guide/introduction.md) cover more advanced topics. The [Flume extensions catalogue](./flume_extensions_catalogue/introduction.md) complete the available documentation for Cygnus.
