# Hardware requirements
The following guidelines are orientative. Since any Cygnus agent based on cygnus-common may have specific requirements, it is recommended to check such specific requirements.

* RAM: 1 GB, specially if abusing of the batching mechanism.
* HDD: A few GB may be enough unless the channel types are configured as `FileChannel` type.
