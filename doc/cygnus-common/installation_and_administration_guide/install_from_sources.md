## <a name="section1"></a>Prerequisites
Maven (and thus Java SDK, since Maven is a Java tool) is needed in order to install cygnus-common.

In order to install Java SDK (not JRE), just type (CentOS machines):

    $ yum install java-1.7.0-openjdk-devel

Remember to export the JAVA_HOME environment variable. In the case of using `yum install` as shown above, it would be:

    $ export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.7.0-openjdk.x86_64

In order to do it permanently, edit `/root/.bash_profile` (`root` user) or `/etc/profile` (other users).

Maven is installed by downloading it from [maven.apache.org](http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi). Install it in a folder of your choice (represented by `APACHE_MAVEN_HOME`):

    $ wget http://www.eu.apache.org/dist/maven/maven-3/3.2.5/binaries/apache-maven-3.2.5-bin.tar.gz
    $ tar xzvf apache-maven-3.2.5-bin.tar.gz
    $ mv apache-maven-3.2.5 APACHE_MAVEN_HOME

## <a name="section2"></a>`cygnus` user creation
It is highly recommended to create a `cygnus` Unix user, under which Cygnus will be installed and run. By the way, this is how the [RPM](./install_with_rpm.md) proceeds.

Creating such a user is quite simple. As a sudoer user (root or any other allowed), type the following:

    $ (sudo) useradd cygnus

You may add a password or not to the `cygnus` user:

    $ (sudo) passwd cygnus

Once created, change to this new fresh user in order to proceed with the rest of the installation:

    $ su - cygnus

## <a name="section3"></a>`log4j` path
Once the user is created is necessary to create the path `/var/log/cygnus` for `log4j` purposes. Start by creating the path and then give permissions for `cygnus` user:

    $ mkdir -p /var/log/cygnus
    $ chown -R cygnus:cygnus /var/log/cygnus

This step is important because if you don't have the log path created Cygnus will shutdown when running for the first time.

## <a name="section4"></a>Installing Apache Flume
Apache Flume can be easily installed by downloading its latests version from [flume.apache.org](http://flume.apache.org/download.html). Move the untared directory to a folder of your choice (represented by `APACHE_FLUME_HOME`):

    $ wget http://www.eu.apache.org/dist/flume/1.4.0/apache-flume-1.4.0-bin.tar.gz
    $ tar xvzf apache-flume-1.4.0-bin.tar.gz
    $ mv apache-flume-1.4.0-bin APACHE_FLUME_HOME
    $ mv APACHE_FLUME_HOME/lib/httpclient-4.2.1.jar APACHE_FLUME_HOME/lib/httpclient-4.2.1.jar.old
    $ mv APACHE_FLUME_HOME/lib/httpcore-4.2.1.jar APACHE_FLUME_HOME/lib/httpcore-4.2.1.jar.old
    $ mv APACHE_FLUME_HOME/lib/libthrift-0.7.0.jar APACHE_FLUME_HOME/lib/libthrift-0.7.0.jar.old
    $ mkdir -p APACHE_FLUME_HOME/plugins.d/cygnus/
    $ mkdir APACHE_FLUME_HOME/plugins.d/cygnus/lib
    $ mkdir APACHE_FLUME_HOME/plugins.d/cygnus/libext

Some remarks:

* The creation of the `plugins.d` directory is related to the installation of third-party software, like Cygnus.
* Please observe the version of `httpcomponents-core` and `httpcomponents-client` in the `pom.xml` (`httpclient-4.3.1.jar and httpcore-4.3.1.jar`) don't match match the version of such packages within the Flume bundle (`httpclient-4.2.1.jar and httpcore-4.2.1.jar`). In order the most recent version of the libraries, the ones within the Flume bundle must be removed (or renamed).

## <a name="section5"></a>Installing cygnus-common
### <a name="section5.1"></a>Cloning `fiware-cygnus`
Start by cloning the Github repository containing cygnus-common:

    $ git clone https://github.com/telefonicaid/fiware-cygnus.git
    $ cd fiware-cygnus
    $ git checkout <branch>

`<branch>` should be typically a stable release branch, e.g. `release/0.13.0`, but could also be `master` (synchronized with the latest release) or `develop` (contains the latest not stable changes).

### <a name="section5.2"></a>Installing `cygnus-common`
The developed classes must be packaged in a Java jar file. This can be done as a fat Java jar containing all the third-party dependencies  (**recommended**). You may need to edit the `pom.xml` (\*):

    $ cd cygnus-common
    $ APACHE_MAVEN_HOME/bin/mvn clean compile exec:exec assembly:single
    $ cp target/cygnus-common-<x.y.z>-jar-with-dependencies.jar APACHE_FLUME_HOME/plugins.d/cygnus/libext

Or as a thin Java jar file containing only the `cygnus-common` classes. You may need to edit the `pom.xml` if necessary (\*):

    $ cd cygnus-common
    $ APACHE_MAVEN_HOME/bin/mvn exec:exec package
    $ cp target/cygnus-<x.y.z>.jar APACHE_FLUME_HOME/plugins.d/cygnus/libext

Please observe in this case, and depending on the Cygnus components you are going to use, you may need to install [additional](#section5) third-party .jar files under `APACHE_FLUME_HOME/plugins.d/cygnus/libext/`. Typically, you can get these jar files from your Maven repository (under `.m2` in your user home directory) and use the `cp` command.

In both cases, the `cygnus-common` dependency must be installed at Maven as well, in order to build any other agent depending on it. Just run the following command:

    $ APACHE_MAVEN_HOME/bin/mvn install:install-file -Dfile=APACHE_FLUME_HOME/plugins.d/cygnus/libext/cygnus-common-<x.y.z>-jar-with-dependencies.jar -DgroupId=com.telefonica.iot -DartifactId=cygnus-common -Dversion=<x.y.z> -Dpackaging=jar -DgeneratePom=false

(*) Please have into account from Cygnus 0.10.0 the version of `hadoop-core` within the `pom.xml` must match the Hadoop version you are going to use; on the contrary, the HDFS sink will not work. Of course, if you are not going to use the HDFS sink, simply use the default `hadoop-core` version (1.2.1) within the downloaded `pom.xml` for correct compilation purposes.

Finally, please find a `compile.sh` script containing all the commands shown in this section. It must be parameterized with the version of the current branch and the Apache Flume base path.

### <a name="section5.3"></a>Installing `cygnus-flume-ng` script
The installation is completed by copying the `cygnus-flume-ng` script into `APACHE_FLUME_HOME/bin`:

    $ cp target/classes/cygnus-flume-ng APACHE_FLUME_HOME/bin
    $ chmod a+x APACHE_FLUME_HOME/bin/cygnus-flume-ng

[Top](#top)

### <a name="section5.4"></a>Known issues
It may happen while compiling `cygnus-common` the Maven JVM has not enough memory. This can be changed as detailed at the [Maven official documentation](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MAVEN/OutOfMemoryError):

    $ export MAVEN_OPTS="-Xmx512m -XX:MaxPermSize=128m"
