#OrionMongoSink
##Functionality
`com.iot.telefonica.cygnus.sinks.OrionMongoSink`, or simply `OrionMongosink` is a sink designed to persist NGSI-like context data events within a MongoDB server. Usually, such a context data is notified by a [Orion Context Broker](https://github.com/telefonicaid/fiware-orion) instance, but could be any other system speaking the <i>NGSI language</i>.

Independently of the data generator, NGSI context data is always [transformed](from_ngsi_events_to_flume_events.md) into internal Flume events at Cygnus sources thanks to `com.iot.telefonica.cygnus.handlers.OrionRestHandler`. In the end, the information within these Flume events must be mapped into specific HDFS data structures.

###Mapping Flume events to MongoDB data structures
MongoDB organizes the data in databases that contain collections of Json documents. Such organization is exploited by `OrionMongoSink` each time a Flume event is taken, by performing the following workflow:

1. The bytes within the event's body are parsed and a `NotifyContextRequest` object container is created.
2. A database called as the `fiware-service` header value within the event is created (if not existing yet).
3. The context responses/entities within the container are iterated, and a collection is created (if not yet existing) for each unit data. The unit data depends on the chosen data model (see the configuration section):
    * <i>collection-per-service-path</i>: the collection is called as the `fiware-servicePath` header value within the event.
    * <i>collection-per-entity</i>: the collection is called as the concatenation of the `fiware-servicePath`_`destination` headers values within the event.
    * <i>collection-per-attribute</i>: the collection is called as the concatenation of the `fiware-servicePath`\_`destination`\_`attrName`.
4. The context attributes within each context response/entity are iterated, and a new Json document is appended to the current collection.

###Example
Assuming the following Flume event is created from a notified NGSI context data (the code below is an <i>object representation</i>, not any real data format):

    flume-event={
        headers={
	        content-type=application/json,
	        fiware-service=vehicles,
	        fiware-servicepath=4wheels,
	        timestamp=1429535775,
	        transactionId=1429535775-308-0000000000,
	        ttl=10,
	        destination=car1_car
        },
        body={
	        entityId=car1,
	        entityType=car,
	        attributes=[
	            {
	                attrName=speed,
	                attrType=kmh,
	                attrValue=112.9
	            },
	            {
	                attrName=oil_level,
	                attrType=percentage,
	                attrValue=74.6
	            }
	        ]
	    }
    }

Assuming `mongo_username=myuser` as configuration parameter, then `OrionMongoSink` will persist the data within the body as:

    $ mongo -u myuser -p
    MongoDB shell version: 2.6.9
    connecting to: test
    > show databases
    admin              (empty)
    local              0.031GB
    vehicles           0.031GB
    test               0.031GB
    > use vehicles
    switched to db vehicles
    > show collections
    4wheels
    4wheels_car1_car
    4wheels_car1_car_speed
    system.indexes
    > db.4wheels.find()
    { "_id" : ObjectId("5534d143fa701f0be751db82"), "recvTimeTs": "1402409899391", "recvTime" : "2015-04-20T12:13:22.41.124UTC", "entityId" : "car1", "entityType" : "car", "attrName" : "speed", "attrType" : "kmh", "attrValue" : "112.9" }
    > db.4wheels_car1_car.find()
    { "_id" : ObjectId("5534d143fa701f0be751db82"), "recvTimeTs": "1402409899391", "recvTime" : "2015-04-20T12:13:22.41.412UTC", "attrName" : "speed", "attrType" : "kmh", "attrValue" : "112.9" }
    > db.4wheels_car1_car_speed.find()
    { "_id" : ObjectId("5534d143fa701f0be751db82"), "recvTimeTs": "1402409899391", "recvTime" : "2015-04-20T12:13:22.41.560UTC", "attrType" : "kmh", "attrValue" : "112.9" }

NOTE: the results for the three different data models (<i>collection-per-service-path</i>, <i>collection-per-entity</i> and <i>collection-per-attribute</i>) are shown respectively; and no database prefix nor collection prefix was used (see next section for more details).

NOTE: `mongo` is the MongoDB CLI for querying the data.

##Configuration
`OrionMongoSink` is configured through the following parameters:

| Parameter | Mandatory | Default value | Comments |
|---|---|---|---|
| type | yes | N/A | com.telefonica.iot.cygnus.sinks.OrionMongoSink |
| channel | yes | N/A |
| mongo_hosts | no | localhost:27017 | FQDN/IP:port where the MongoDB server runs (standalone case) or comma-separated list of FQDN/IP:port pairs where the MongoDB replica set members run
| mongo_username | no | <i>empty</i> |
| mongo_password | no | <i>empty</i> |
| data_model | no | collection-per-entity | Under study
| db_prefix | no | <i>empty</i> | Should not be public
| collection_prefix | no | <i>empty</i> | Should not be public

A configuration example could be:

    cygnusagent.sinks = mongo-sink
    cygnusagent.channels = mongo-channel
    ...
    cygnusagent.sinks.mongo-sink.type = com.telefonica.iot.cygnus.sinks.OrionMongoSink
    cygnusagent.sinks.mongo-sink.channel = mongo-channel
    cygnusagent.sinks.mongo-sink.mongo_hosts = 192.168.80.34:27017
    cygnusagent.sinks.mongo-sink.mongo_username = myuser
    cygnusagent.sinks.mongo-sink.mongo_password = mypassword
    cygnusagent.sinks.mongo-sink.data_model = collection-per-entity
    cygnusagent.sinks.mongo-sink.db_prefix = cygnus_
    cygnusagent.sinks.mongo-sink.collection_prefix = cygnus_

## Use cases
Use `OrionMongoSink` if you are looking for a Json-based document storage not growing so much in the mid-long term.
