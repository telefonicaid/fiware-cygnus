#OrionCKANSink
##Functionality
`com.iot.telefonica.cygnus.sinks.OrionCKANSink`, or simply `OrionCKANSink` is a sink designed to persist NGSI-like context data events within a [CKAN](http://ckan.org/) server. Usually, such a context data is notified by a [Orion Context Broker](https://github.com/telefonicaid/fiware-orion) instance, but could be any other system speaking the <i>NGSI language</i>.

Independently of the data generator, NGSI context data is always [transformed](from_ngsi_events_to_flume_events.md) into internal Flume events at Cygnus sources thanks to `com.iot.telefonica.cygnus.handlers.OrionRestHandler`. In the end, the information within these Flume events must be mapped into specific HDFS data structures.

###Mapping Flume events to CKAN data structures
[CKAN organizes](http://docs.ckan.org/en/latest/user-guide.html) the data in organizations containing packages or datasets; each one of these packages/datasets contains several resources whose data is finally stored in a PostgreSQL database (CKAN Datastore) or plain files (CKAN Filestore). Such organization is exploited by `OrionCKANSink` each time a Flume event is taken, by performing the following workflow:

1. The bytes within the event's body are parsed and a `NotifyContextRequest` object container is created.
2. According to the [naming conventions](naming_convetions.md), an organization called as the `fiware-service` header values is created (if not existing yet). The same occurs with a package/dataset called as the `fiware-servicePath` header value.
3. The context responses/entities within the container are iterated, and a resource called as the `destination` header value is created (if not yet existing). A datastore associated to the resource is created as well.
4. The context attributes within each context response/entity are iterated, and a new data row is upserted in the datastore related to the resource. The format for this append depends on the configured persistence mode:
    * `row`: A data row is upserted for each notified context attribute. This kind of row will always contain 8 fields:
        * `recvTimeTs`: UTC timestamp expressed in miliseconds.
        * `recvTime`: UTC timestamp in human-redable format ([ISO 6801](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601)).
        * `entityId`: Notified entity identifier.
        * `entityType`: Notified entity type.
        * `attrName`: Notified attribute name.
        * `attrType`: Notified attribute type.
        * `attrValue`: In its simplest form, this value is just a string, but since Orion 0.11.0 it can be Json object or Json array.
        * `attrMd`: It contains a string serialization of the metadata array for the attribute in Json (if the attribute hasn't metadata, an empty array `[]` is inserted).
    * `column`: A single row is upserted for all the notified context attributes. This kind of row will contain two fields per each entity's attribute (one for the value, called `<attrName>`, and other for the metadata, called `<attrName>_md`), plus an additional field about the reception time of the data (`recvTime`).

####Important notes regarding the persistence mode
Please observe not always the same number of attributes is notified; this depends on the subscription made to the NGSI-like sender. This is not a problem for the `row` persistence mode, since fixed 8-fields rows are upserted for each notified attribute. Nevertheless, the `column` mode may be affected by several rows of different lengths (in term of fields). Thus, the `column` mode is only recommended if your subscription is designed for always sending the same attributes, event if they were not updated since the last notification.

In addition, when running in `column` mode, due to the number of notified attributes (and therefore the number of fields to be written within the Datastore) is unknown by Cygnus, the Datastore can not be automatically created, and must be provisioned previously to the Cygnus execution. That's not the case of the `row` mode since the number of fields to be written is always constant, independently of the number of notified attributes.

###Example
Assuming the following Flume event is created from a notified NGSI context data (the code below is an <i>object representation</i>, not any real data format):

    flume-event={
        headers={
	        content-type=application/json,
	        fiware-service=vehicles,
	        fiware-servicepath=4wheels,
	        timestamp=1429535775,
	        transactionId=1429535775-308-0000000000,
	        ttl=10,
	        destination=car1_car
        },
        body={
	        entityId=car1,
	        entityType=car,
	        attributes=[
	            {
	                attrName=speed,
	                attrType=kmh,
	                attrValue=112.9
	            },
	            {
	                attrName=oil_level,
	                attrType=percentage,
	                attrValue=74.6
	            }
	        ]
	    }
    }

Assuming `api_key=myapikey` and `attr_persistence=row` as configuration parameter, then `OrionCKANSink` will persist the data within the body as:

                    "attrName": "oil_level",
                    "_id": 2
                }
            ],
            "_links": {

NOTE: `curl` is a Unix command allowing for interacting with REST APIs such as the exposed by CKAN.

##Configuration
`OrionCKANSink` is configured through the following parameters:

| Parameter | Mandatory | Default value | Comments |
|---|---|---|---|
| type | yes | N/A | Must be <i>com.telefonica.iot.cygnus.sinks.OrionCKANSink</i> |
| channel | yes | N/A |
| ckan_host | no | localhost | FQDN/IP address where the CKAN server runs |
| ckan_port | no | 80 |
| ssl | no | false |
| api_key | yes | N/A |
| attr_persistence | no | row | <i>row</i> or <i>column</i>
| orion_url | no |Â http://localhost:1026 | To be put as the filestore URL |

A configuration example could be:

    cygnusagent.sinks = ckan-sink
    cygnusagent.channels = ckan-channel
    ...
    cygnusagent.sinks.ckan-sink.type = com.telefonica.iot.cygnus.sinks.OrionCKANSink
    cygnusagent.sinks.ckan-sink.channel = ckan-channel
    cygnusagent.sinks.ckan-sink.ckan_host = 192.168.80.34
    cygnusagent.sinks.ckan-sink.ckan_port = 80
    cygnusagent.sinks.ckan-sink.ssl = false
    cygnusagent.sinks.ckan-sink.api_key = myapikey
    cygnusagent.sinks.ckan-sink.attr_persistence = column
    cygnusagent.sinks.ckan-sink.orion_url = http://localhost:1026

## Use cases
Use `OrionCKANSink` if you are looking for a Json-based document storage growing in the mid-long term.
