# Reporting issues and contact information
There are several channels suited for reporting issues and asking for doubts in general. Each one depends on the nature of the question:

* Use [stackoverflow.com](http://stackoverflow.com) for specific questions about this software. Typically, these will be related to installation problems, errors and bugs. Development questions when forking the code are welcome as well. Use the `fiware-cygnus` tag.
* Use [ask.fiware.org](https://ask.fiware.org/questions/) for general questions about FIWARE, e.g. how many cities are using FIWARE, how can I join the accelarator program, etc. Even for general questions about this software, for instance, use cases or architectures you want to discuss.
* Personal email:
    * [francisco.romerobueno@telefonica.com](mailto:francisco.romerobueno@telefonica.com) **[Main contributor]**
    * [pablo.coellovillalba@telefonica.com](mailto:pablo.coellovillaba@telefonica.com) **[Contributor]**

**NOTE**: Please try to avoid personally emailing the contributors unless they ask for it. In fact, if you send a private email you will probably receive an automatic response enforcing you to use [stackoverflow.com](http://stackoverflow.com/) or [ask.fiware.org](https://ask.fiware.org/questions/). This is because using the mentioned methods will create a public database of knowledge that can be useful for future users; private email is just private and cannot be shared.
