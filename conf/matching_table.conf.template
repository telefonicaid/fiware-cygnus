# This file defines a matching table for context data grouping. The table is composed of several mathcing rules. It
# works by defining a set of fields within the Orion notification and a regular expression to be applied over the
# concatenation of those fields. If there is a matching then the destination within the matching rule is used as the
# name of the permanent storage for the data (it will be a file in the case of HDFS, a MySQL table or a CKAN resource).
# 
# Append as many matching rules as you need, following this format:
#
# integer id|comma-separated fields|regex to be applied to the fields concatenation|destination|dataset
#
# The available "dictionary" of fields is:
#  - entitydId
#  - entityType
#  - servicePath

1|entityId,entityType|Room\.(\d*)Room|numeric_rooms|rooms
2|entityId|Car|cars|vehicles
3|servicePath|GARDENS|gardens|city_indicators
