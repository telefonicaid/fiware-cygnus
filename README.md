Cygnus is a connector in charge of persisting context data sources into other third-party databases and storage systems, creating a historical view of the context. Internally, Cygnus is based on [Apache Flume](http://flume.apache.org/), Flume is a data flow system based on the concepts of flow-based programming. It supports powerful and scalable directed graphs of data routing, transformation, and system mediation logic. It was built to automate the flow of data between systems. While the term 'dataflow' can be used in a variety of contexts, we use it here to mean the automated and managed flow of information between systems.

Each data persistence agent within Cygnus is composed of three parts - a listener or source in charge of receiving the data, a channel where the source puts the data once it has been transformed into a Flume event, and a sink, which takes Flume events from the channel in order to persist the data within its body into a third-party storage.

This project is part of [FIWARE](https://www.fiware.org/). For more information

[Core Context Management](https://github.com/Fiware/catalogue/tree/master/core).

# Background

Internally, Cygnus is based on [Apache Flume](http://flume.apache.org/), a technology addressing the design and execution of data collection and persistence <i>agents</i>. An agent is basically composed of a listener or source in charge of receiving the data, a channel where the source puts the data once it has been transformed into a Flume event, and a sink, which takes Flume events from the channel in order to persist the data within its body into a third-party storage.

Cygnus is designed to run a specific Flume agent per source of data.

Current stable release is able to persist the following sources of data in the following third-party storages:

* NGSI-like context data in:
    * [HDFS](http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-hdfs/HdfsUserGuide.html), the [Hadoop](http://hadoop.apache.org/) distributed file system.
    * [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/), the well-known relational database manager.
    * [CKAN](http://ckan.org/), an Open Data platform.
    * [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/), the NoSQL document-oriented database.
    * [STH Comet](https://github.com/telefonicaid/IoT-STH), a Short-Term Historic database built on top of MongoDB.
    * [Kafka](http://kafka.apache.org/), the publish-subscribe messaging broker.
    * [DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/), a cloud-based NoSQL database by [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/).
    * [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/), the well-known relational database manager.
    * [Carto](https://carto.com/), the database specialized in geolocated data.
* Twitter data in:
    * [HDFS](http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-hdfs/HdfsUserGuide.html), the [Hadoop](http://hadoop.apache.org/) distributed file system.

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: for the time being, `cygnus-ngsi` and `cygnus-twitter` agents cannot be installed in the same base path, because of an incompatibility with the required version of the `httpclient` library. Of course, if you are going to use just one of the agents, there is no problem at all.

## Cygnus place in FIWARE architecture
Cygnus (more specifically, cygnus-ngsi agent) plays the role of a connector between Orion Context Broker (which is a NGSI source of data) and many FIWARE storages such as CKAN, Cosmos Big Data (Hadoop) and STH Comet. Of course, as previously said, you may add MySQL, Kafka, Carto, etc as other non FIWARE storages to the FIWARE architecture.

## Further documentation
The per agent **Quick Start Guide** found at readthedocs.org provides a good documentation summary ([cygnus-ngsi](http://fiware-cygnus.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cygnus-ngsi/quick_start_guide/index.html), [cygnus-twitter](http://fiware-cygnus.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cygnus-twitter/quick_start_guide/index.html)).

Nevertheless, both the **Installation and Administration Guide** and the **User and Programmer Guide** for each agent also found at [readthedocs.org](http://fiware-cygnus.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) cover more advanced topics.

The per agent **Flume Extensions Catalogue** completes the available documentation for Cygnus ([cygnus-ngsi](http://fiware-cygnus.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cygnus-ngsi/flume_extensions_catalogue/introduction/index.html), [cygnus-twitter](http://fiware-cygnus.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cygnus-twitter/flume_extensions_catalogue/introduction/index.html)).
